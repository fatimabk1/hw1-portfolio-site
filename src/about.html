                I’m Fatima Kahbi, an iOS developer currently pursuing a master’s degree in Software Engineering. My journey into software development has been shaped by hands-on experience at companies like Digital Factory and L3Harris, where I explored geolocation and technology ethics.

                Outside of coding, I enjoy finding creative ways to decorate and organize my space. It’s my favorite way to unwind while bringing structure and beauty to my life!
