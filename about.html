        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’m Fatima Kahbi, an iOS developer currently pursuing a master’s degree in Software Engineering. My journey into software development has been shaped by hands-on experience at companies like Digital Factory, where I worked with fine-grain geofencing technology, and L3Harris, where I contributed to geolocation-based solutions. Along the way, I’ve developed a deep interest in personal finance, technology ethics, and the fascinating potential of location-aware applications to enhance user experiences.</p>
        <h2>Fun Facts About Me!</h2>
        <p>When I’m not coding, I love finding creative ways to decorate and organize my space. It’s a fun and refreshing way to bring order and beauty into my daily life, much like crafting clean and efficient code!</p>
